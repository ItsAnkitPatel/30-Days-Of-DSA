In every coding interview when the interviewer asks a coding question and you give your approach then he/she will definitely going to ask that "_What is the time and space complexity of this approach that you have given to me ?_" <br>
"_Is there any better approach than this one ?_"

**What is Time & Space complexity ?**
>Time complexity basically is : The total time taken by a program (or we can say function input length) to run is called Time complexity.<br>

>Space complexity : the total extra spaces(like creation of an array during run time ) that is used by the program for its execution is called Space complexity.

**Why we need it ?**
>To compare the efficiency of algorithms and make comparisons between other algorithms efficiency.
