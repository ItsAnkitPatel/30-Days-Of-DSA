**What is Time & Space complexity ?**
>Time complexity basically is : the total time taken by a program (or we can say function input length) to run is called Time complexity.<br>

>Space complexity : the total extra spaces(like creation of an array during run time ) that is used by the program for its execution is called Space complexity.
