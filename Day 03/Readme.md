In every coding interview when the interviewer asks a coding question and you give your approach then he/she will definitely going to ask that "_What is the time and space complexity of this approach that you have given to me ?_" <br>
"_Is there any better approach than this one ?_"

**What is Time & Space complexity ?**
>Time complexity basically is : The total time taken by a program (or we can say function input length) to run for doing a specific task is called Time complexity.<br>

>Space complexity : The total memory taken by the program for its execution is called Space complexity.

**Why we need it ?**
>To compare the efficiency of algorithms and make comparisons between other algorithms efficiency which doing the same task but their running time is different and to measure that we use these two concepts everytime in every program.

**How to show/denote time and space complexity ?**
>By using notations
- Big O notation (Upper Bound)  &ensp; _O is not_ ~zero(0)~   *it's alphabet of english i.e O*
- Theta (Average Bound)
- Omega (Lower Bound)

We mainly use Big O to give an upper bound to show running time of an program, means a program will not cross this limit whatever time it will take it will be under this big O.

For
- Constant time : O(1) we say it as "Big O of 1" time complexity
- Linear time : O(n) we say it as "Big O of n" time complexity
- Logarithmic time : O(log n)
- Quadratic time : O(n<sup>2</sup>) we say it as "Big O of n square" time complexity
- Cubic time : O(n<sup>3</sup>)

**Best to worst time complexity**

1. O(1)
2. O(log n)
3. O(n)
4. O(n log n)
5. O(n<sup>2</sup>)
6. O(n<sup>3</sup>)
7. O(2<sup>n</sup>)
8. O(N!)


>I recommend you better watch the video for better understanding of the concepts. Video cleared my all doubts now I understand this topic clearly.
