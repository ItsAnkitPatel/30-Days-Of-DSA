If we take Linear search to find our target value in an array the time complexity it will take in worst case is O(n). <br>
Because we are comparing our target value with each index value of an array.

To beat this O(n) complexity for searching our target in an array we have another algorithm which is much efficient than Linear search.
>i.e. Binary Search

Binary search divides an array in half and search in that section only and we keep repeating this until we find our target in the array<br>
or we left with only one index in the end.

>**Note :** Binary search works only in _monotonic function_(sound very fancy right ?) ,means the values should be in increasing order or decreasing order<br>
>Inshort binary search works only on sorted(increasing or decreasing order) array only.
